  "readme": "# WebVR Boilerplate\n\nA starting point for web-based VR experiences that work well in both\nGoogle Cardboard and Oculus Rift. Also provides a good fallback for\nexperiencing the same content without requiring a VR device.\n\nUses the [webvr-polyfill project][polyfill] to provide VR support even\nif no VR device is available. This gives good fallbacks for Cardboard,\nmobile devices and desktop devices.\n\n[polyfill]: https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill\n\n# What's inside...\n\n[**THREE.js** `three.min.js`](http://threejs.org/)\n\n- WebGL helper library that greatly simplifies 3D graphics.\n\n[**VRControls** `VRControls.js`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/controls/VRControls.js)\n\n- THREE.js controls which take advantage of the WebVR API.\n- Usually attached to the THREE.Camera to look around the scene.\n\n[**VREffect** `VREffect.js`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/effects/VREffect.js)\n\n- THREE.js effect which renders a scene with two cameras in it.\n- Puts the two images side-by-side.\n\n[**WebVR polyfill** `webvr-polyfill.js`](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill)\n\n- For Cardboard rendering.\n- On mobile, supports rotation via DeviceOrientation.\n- On desktop, supports looking with the mouse or with arrow keys.\n\n**WebVR manager** `webvr-manager.js` (lives in this repository)\n\n- Feature detects for WebVR (or the polyfill).\n- If WebVR is available, places an active WebVR button on the bottom.\n- Other means of getting into VR mode: double click anywhere, double tap\n  anywhere.\n- For desktop, if an HMD is connected, goes into split-screen rendering\n  mode. Otherwise, goes into immersive fullscreen mode (with pointer lock).\n- For mobile, goes into Cardboard side-by-side rendering mode.\n\nTODO: Provide a configuration UI for switching modes if we guessed\nwrong.\n\n# Instructions\n\n1. Include webvr-polyfill.js in your project.\n2. Include webvr-manager.js and instantiate a WebVRManager object,\n   passing in your VREffect instance (from the THREE.js effect library)\n   as first argument.\n\nFor example,\n\n    var effect = new THREE.VREffect(renderer);\n    var mgr = new WebVRManager(effect);\n\nFor more information, see index.html, which should be well commented and\nself-explanatory.\n\n\n# Related projects\n\n- WebVR Polyfill: <https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill>\n- A yeoman-based getting started template: <https://github.com/dmarcos/vrwebgl>\n- LEAP's VR quickstart: <https://github.com/leapmotion-examples/javascript/blob/master/v2/vr-quickstart/index.html>\n- A WebVR Polyfill that is unfortunately incomplete: <https://github.com/thomasfoster96/WebVR-polyfill>\n- A three.js + VR starting point: <https://github.com/MozVR/vr-web-examples/tree/master/threejs-vr-boilerplate>\n\n\n# Useful resources\n\n- Cardboard Java SDK: https://github.com/googlesamples/cardboard-java\n- Brandon's info on Chrome's WebVR implementation: http://blog.tojicode.com/2014/07/bringing-vr-to-chrome.html\n- Vlad's quick guide to the WebVR API: http://blog.bitops.com/blog/2014/06/26/first-steps-for-vr-on-the-web/\n- The WebVR IDL: https://github.com/vvuk/gecko-dev/blob/oculus/dom/webidl/VRDevice.webidl\n",

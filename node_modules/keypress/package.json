For details and documentation, please\nvisit [http://dmauro.github.io/Keypress/](http://dmauro.github.io/Keypress/)\n\nCopyright 2014 David Mauro\nreleased under the Apache License, version 2.0\n\n\n**What's new**\n---------------\n\n2.1.0\n\n* Another fix for unregistering combos using an array of keys\n* Added a destroy method to cleanup a listener. Thanks to [smerickson](https://github.com/smerickson) for submitting. [Pull request #51](https://github.com/dmauro/Keypress/pull/51)\n* Fixed compatibility for '-'/'_' and '='/'+' keys in FireFox. Thanks to [simonsarris](https://github.com/simonsarris) for spotting the bug. [Issue #50](https://github.com/dmauro/Keypress/issues/50)\n* Added []spm support](http://spmjs.io/package/keypress). Thanks to [sorrycc](https://github.com/sorrycc). [Pull request #52](https://github.com/dmauro/Keypress/pull/52)\n\n2.0.3\n\n* Fixed a bug unregistering combos using arrays of keys\n* Added ie8 compatibility shim. Thanks to [barrkel](https://github.com/barrkel). [Issue #41](https://github.com/dmauro/Keypress/issues/41)\n* Fixed a bug targetting the semicolon key in Firefox. Thanks to [mikekuehn](https://github.com/mikekuehn).\n* Added commonJS module support. [Issue #45](https://github.com/dmauro/Keypress/issues/45)\n\n2.0.2\n\n* Fixed a bug that prevented combos from unregistering, and updated the docs for how to unregister properly. Thanks to [pelly](https://github.com/pelly) and [g00fy-](https://github.com/g00fy-). [Issue # 34](https://github.com/dmauro/Keypress/issues/34).\n* Added [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html) support. [Issue #37](https://github.com/dmauro/Keypress/issues/37).\n\n2.0.1\n\n* Fixed a big ole bug with meta/cmd combos. Thanks to [lexey111](https://github.com/lexey111). [Issue #29](https://github.com/dmauro/Keypress/issues/29).\n* Fixed a bug with the Windows key being released on Windows systems. [Issue #27](https://github.com/dmauro/Keypress/issues/27).\n\n2.0.0\n\n* Keypress now has a listener class that must be instantiated. The functions that were previously in the global window.keypress object are now public methods of the window.keypress.Listener class.\n* Each instance of a Keypress listener can be bound to a DOM element by passing in the element to the listener's constructor.\n* Combos now default to being ordered (the property is now called is_unordered and is false by default).\n* Combos' handlers preventDefault unless the handler returns true.\n* The \"combo\" public method is now called \"simple_combo\".\n* The basic combo helpers for simple, counting and sequence combos no longer have a third prevent_default optional parameter.\n* Debugging console logs can be enabled by setting keypress.debug to true.\n* All key event callbacks send a third argument specifying whether the event is firing again automatically because the key has remained pressed down.\n\n1.0.9\n\n* Fix escape key bug. Issue #17.\n* Fix unregister bug. Issue #24.\n\n1.0.8\n\n* Ensure that on_release is called for all combos, not just counting combos.\n* Fix bug that was causing is_ordered to be ignored.\n* Fixed an edge case for a counting combo's count not being reset.\n* Improve how key events are bound\n\n1.0.7\n\n* Fixed combo matching to prevent performance issues as more keys are pressed.\n\n1.0.6\n\n* Fixed a bug with exclusive combos not properly excluding each other in some cases.\n* Feature added to allow for combos that do not fire if unrelated keys are also pressed (\"is_solitary\" boolean).\n\n\n\nTODO\n----\n\n* Put negative edge in sequences.\n* See if we can do away with keyup_fired and count properties.\n",
